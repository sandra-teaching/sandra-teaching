- Hello, this is Sandra Batista, @sandra-teaching. I am a computer scientist and for several years I was teaching faculty, but now focusing on research. 
This GitHub account contains resources from teaching materials I have made over the years.
- For videos on discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, please check out my YouTube channel: [At the Whiteboard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrCma-Gy4S1mmqf_3PEF2Nw)
- For resources from a discrete mathematics course including logic and graph theory, please check out this repo: [Discrete Mathematics](https://github.com/sandra-teaching/USC_CSCI170_Spring2021)
- For resources from a data structures and algorithms course in C++ course, please check out this repo: [Data Structures and Algorithms in C++](https://github.com/sandraleebatista/csci104_fall2020_lecture)
- Maybe some day I will post on Python and research...
- My research work is at the intersection of computational genetics, bioinformatics, statistical methods, and machine learning. I may post videos about that soon enough,
but really my focus is research these days
- Please feel free to reach me regarding teaching here on GitHub by raising issues in the repo.
- Thank you and best wishes!! And if you use these materials to study, I hope you do well.

- P.S. If you would like some Python resources, please consider these resources from Jordan Freitas at LMU on Python in this repo: [Introductory Python Resources from LMU](https://github.com/jordan-freitas/lmu-cmsi185-spring2020)
